# math_pendulum_DAE
Investigation on numerical methods for solving DAE problems in the case of a mathematical pendulum.

Structure of a repo

### example
Folder contains some third-party code that was used for initial solution analysis and source code verification

### graph 
Folder contains plots that was produced as a result of calculations

### symbolic_estimation
Folder constains sympy scripts for calculating of Jacobian eigen values and some other derivatives

### root directory

bdf_calculation.py and index_reduction_calculation.py is a main scripts that constain code for solving DAE problem. Other source files implement numerical integration
